    -   **Admin:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for managing job postings.
    -   **Student:** Can view all available job listings and submit applications directly through the portal.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **RESTful API Architecture:** A well-structured backend API built with Spring Boot enables a clean separation of concerns and scalable development.
-   üì± **Responsive Frontend:** The user interface is crafted with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to be fully responsive, offering an optimal user experience on any device.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a classic client-server architecture:

1.  **Frontend (Client):** A responsive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that handles user interaction and sends HTTP requests to the backend.
2.  **Backend (Server):** A Spring Boot application that exposes a RESTful API. It manages business logic, security with Spring Security & JWT, and data persistence.
3.  **Database:** A PostgreSQL database stores all application data, including user credentials, job postings, and student applications.


## (Local Setup)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or later)
-   Apache Maven 3.x or later
-   PostgreSQL Server

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**
    -   Start your PostgreSQL server.
    -   Create a new database for the project.
    -   Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the following properties with your PostgreSQL credentials:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db_name
        spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies and run the backend:**
    ```sh
    mvn install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    -   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
    -   Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the application.

### Credentials for Testing

-   **Admin:** `username: admin_user` / `password: admin_pass`
-   **User:** `username: student_user` / `password: student_pass`
